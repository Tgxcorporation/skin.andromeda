Fork to update addons.xml for Kodi 19 Matrix

Install this repo for some of the dependecies:

https://github.com/kodi-community-addons/repository.marcelveldt

And then you might need to still download a few as zips and install them manually (I had to for script.skin.helper.backgrounds)

These are dependencies you need:

script.skin.helper.service (Install from repo)
script.skin.helper.backgrounds
script.skin.helper.colorpicker
script.skin.helper.skinbackup

Github if you need the zips:
